ME AND DATA AND ORBY AND LOGGO AND DUSKIE WE CODED IT

Duskiewhy made the engine /////////// some stuff by data5 
(Nightmare Vision)


## set ur libs ok.

In a cmd within the project directory, in order run...

> haxelib install hxpkg --global

> haxelib run hxpkg setup --global

> hxpkg install

### Quick Note
- this engine ENFORCES use of hxpkg for libraries to prevent issues in relation to `hxvlc`
- if u have .haxelibs installed already delete em probably lol


After that is complete, run `lime test windows` and you should be compiling
